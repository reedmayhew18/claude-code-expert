# Grill Me - Design Tree Exploration

## Goal

Reach a shared, unambiguous understanding of what the user wants to build before any implementation begins. Success = a concrete implementation plan the user has approved, with all blocking decisions resolved.

## Dependencies

- Tools: Read, Grep, Glob (read-only — this skill gathers information, never modifies files)
- No external services or MCP servers required

## Context

This skill reads the existing project (CLAUDE.md, README, config files) to pre-fill known answers before asking any questions. The less the user has to repeat themselves, the better. Reference `reference/02-best-practices.md` if uncertain about Claude Code patterns.

---

Interview the user about their plan until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one by one.

## Modes

### Full Mode (default): `/grill-me [topic]`
Relentless, thorough interview. Explores every branch of the design tree until zero ambiguity remains. Use for complex features, architecture decisions, or anything where getting it wrong is expensive.

### Light Mode: `/grill-me lightly [topic]`
Quick, focused interview — 5-8 questions max. Gets the essential decisions made without deep-diving every branch. Use for quick setups, small features, or when the user just needs to fill in a few gaps. Skip edge cases and failure modes unless they're critical. Aim for "good enough to start" not "perfectly specified."

## Pre-Fill: Check the Codebase First

**Before asking ANY questions**, check if you're in an existing project:

1. Look for: CLAUDE.md, README.md, package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, go.mod, Makefile, Dockerfile, src/, tests/
2. If an existing project is found:
   - Read CLAUDE.md, README, and config files to understand the project
   - Identify: tech stack, architecture, conventions, existing patterns
   - Note what you already know and what's still unclear
   - **Only ask about the gaps** — don't ask questions the codebase already answers
   - Start by saying: "I've looked at your project. Here's what I understand: [summary]. Let me ask about what I'm less sure about..."
3. If no project exists (empty directory or new project):
   - Start from scratch with the full interview

## Rules
1. If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead of asking
2. Ask one focused question at a time, not batches
3. When a decision opens new branches (e.g., "advanced search" → filters, sorting, pagination), explore each branch (full mode) or note it for later (light mode)
4. Don't accept vague answers — ask follow-ups until the answer is specific and implementable
5. Track decisions made so far to avoid re-asking

## Process (Full Mode)

### Phase 1: Big Picture
- What is the user trying to build?
- Who is it for?
- What does success look like?

### Phase 2: Design Tree
For each major component:
- What are the options?
- What are the tradeoffs?
- Which option fits the constraints?
- What does this decision imply for other decisions?

### Phase 3: Edge Cases & Failure Modes
- What happens when things go wrong?
- What are the performance constraints?
- What are the security considerations?
- What data validation is needed?

### Phase 4: Synthesis
After all questions are answered:
1. Summarize all decisions made
2. Highlight any tensions or tradeoffs
3. Propose a concrete implementation plan
4. Ask if anything was missed

**CHECKPOINT:** Present the full synthesis to the user. Do NOT recommend next steps until they confirm.
Ask: "Does this capture everything accurately? Anything missing or wrong before we move to implementation?"

## Process (Light Mode)

### Phase 1: Quick Context
- What are you building? (one sentence)
- What's the most important thing it needs to do?
- Any hard constraints? (tech stack, timeline, platform)

### Phase 2: Key Decisions Only
- Ask about the 3-5 biggest decisions that would block progress
- Skip theoretical edge cases — focus on "what do I need to know to start building?"

### Phase 3: Quick Summary
1. Summarize decisions in bullet points
2. Note anything deferred for later
3. Recommend next step (usually `/wizard` or `/plan-and-spec`)

**CHECKPOINT:** Present the summary to the user before recommending next steps.
Ask: "Does this look right? Ready to move forward, or anything to adjust?"

## Output

- **Format:** Inline chat — a structured summary presented in the conversation, not saved to a file
- **Full mode deliverable:** Decisions list + tensions/tradeoffs + concrete implementation plan
- **Light mode deliverable:** Bullet-point decisions + deferred items + recommended next step
- **Save location:** None by default. If the user wants it persisted, write to `PLAN.md` or `PROGRESS.md` in the project root and note it survives context compaction.

## Key Principle
The goal is NOT to ask a fixed list of questions. The goal is to dynamically explore the design tree until the level of clarity matches the mode: **Full mode = zero ambiguity. Light mode = enough to start.**
